# Harness Feedback

## What's Working

- **Stop hook + distiller flag** — tool counter correctly triggers distiller_needed flag at threshold (confirmed at 73 calls). Flag mechanism works end-to-end.
- **PreToolUse hook** — correctly blocks `git push main/master`, `git push --force`, `rm -rf`, `sudo`. `hookSpecificOutput` JSON format works with current Claude Code version.
- **Feature pipeline (PR #4)** — successful end-to-end run: spec → implementer → review → holdouts → simplify → merge. Game code healthy.
- **SessionStart hook** — provides good context: branch warnings, crash recovery, distiller status, health checks.
- **Agent-scoped holdouts deny + GODOT_BIN (PR #9)** — global `Read(.claude/holdouts/**)` removed; implementer blocked from holdouts via a frontmatter PreToolUse hook (correct `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` format — the old `{"decision": "deny"}` shape was silently ignored). Reviewer + orchestrator keep access. `env.GODOT_BIN` set so bare `dotnet test` passes. Verified: implementer Read denied, reviewer Read allowed, orchestrator `ls` allowed.

## What's Broken

- **Session transcript capture** — `.claude/transcripts/session-*.txt` files are created nearly empty (38 bytes, end timestamp only). No meaningful conversation data is captured. This limits distiller's ability to analyze conversation patterns. Fix requires a SessionEnd hook or modification to stop.sh — both high risk, blocked for distiller. Human should consider adding a SessionEnd hook to settings.json that writes transcript data.

## Distiller Observations

### 2026-07-10 — First Distillation

- CI thrashing is the most significant pattern: 11+ commits in a row to fix CI suggests agents lack local CI validation capability. Consider adding CI iteration guidance.
- Memory files had stale placeholder text. Updated to reflect current state.
- No prior distillation had ever run — counter system works correctly.
