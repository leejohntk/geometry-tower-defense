# Harness Feedback

## What's Working

- **Stop hook + distiller flag** — tool counter correctly triggers distiller_needed flag at threshold (confirmed at 73 calls). Flag mechanism works end-to-end.
- **PreToolUse hook** — correctly blocks `git push main/master`, `git push --force`, `rm -rf`, `sudo`. `hookSpecificOutput` JSON format works with current Claude Code version.
- **Feature pipeline (PR #4)** — successful end-to-end run: spec → implementer → review → holdouts → simplify → merge. Game code healthy.
- **SessionStart hook** — provides good context: branch warnings, crash recovery, distiller status, health checks.
- **Agent-scoped holdouts deny + GODOT_BIN (PR #9)** — global `Read(.claude/holdouts/**)` removed; implementer blocked from holdouts via a frontmatter PreToolUse hook (correct `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` format — the old `{"decision": "deny"}` shape was silently ignored). Reviewer + orchestrator keep access. `env.GODOT_BIN` set so bare `dotnet test` passes. Verified: implementer Read denied, reviewer Read allowed, orchestrator `ls` allowed.

## What's Broken

- **Session transcript capture** — `.claude/transcripts/session-*.txt` files are created nearly empty (38 bytes, end timestamp only). No meaningful conversation data is captured. This limits distiller's ability to analyze conversation patterns. Fix requires a SessionEnd hook or modification to stop.sh — both high risk, blocked for distiller. Human should consider adding a SessionEnd hook to settings.json that writes transcript data. **Still unresolved as of 2026-09-17 — third distillation run in a row blocked from conversation-level analysis.**
- **Inert PreToolUse hooks in agent frontmatter** — three agent hooks still emit the legacy `{"decision": "deny"}` shape that PR #9 proved is silently ignored by Claude Code v2+:
  - `.claude/agents/reviewer.md:12` — read-only guard (agent has `Bash`, so this is its only real guard)
  - `.claude/agents/investigator.md:12` — read-only guard (same `Bash` caveat)
  - `.claude/agents/distiller.md:19` — harness-write-scope guard (agent has `Write`/`Edit`, so nothing scopes it)

  PR #9 migrated only `.claude/agents/implementer.md`. These three were left behind, so the "deterministic" claims in `harness-safety.md` and `dark-factory-patterns.md` do not hold for them. The distiller hook has a second defect: it reads the file path from `$1`, but PreToolUse input arrives as stdin JSON — `pre-tool-use.sh:5` does this correctly (`INPUT=$(cat)`). Fixing requires editing agent hook frontmatter — **HIGH risk, human only** (see Distiller Observations 2026-09-17 for the exact patch).

## Distiller Observations

### 2026-07-10 — First Distillation

- CI thrashing is the most significant pattern: 11+ commits in a row to fix CI suggests agents lack local CI validation capability. Consider adding CI iteration guidance.
- Memory files had stale placeholder text. Updated to reflect current state.
- No prior distillation had ever run — counter system works correctly.

### 2026-09-17 — Second Distillation

- **Flag was set but never acted on for ~2.5 months** (flagged 2026-09-17T02:25:51, last run 2026-07-11; counter reached 45 against a threshold of 12). An entire feature — level 2 / swarm / cannon (PR #8) — shipped with no distillation. The flag is advisory: nothing gates on it. `session-start.sh` reports the status and `implement-feature/SKILL.md` step 7 mentions triggering, but neither blocks. Proposal M4 below.
- **Highest-value finding:** the inert agent hooks (see "What's Broken"). PR #9 fixed the implementer and explicitly documented that the legacy format fails, but the three sibling hooks were never migrated.
- **Swarm formation bug** (PR #8 `fix(swarm)` commit): cluster members stacked because `MoveAlongPath` snapped `Position` to the shared waypoint, erasing the per-member offset. Root cause was conflating the simulation anchor with a presentation offset. Resolved in `src/Enemies/Enemy.cs` by keeping `_anchorPosition` + `_formationOffset` separate and recomputing `Position = anchor + offset` each tick. Only one observed occurrence, so proposed as guidance (M2), not a rule change.
- **`.claude/specs/` is orphaned** — no harness document references it. `commands/spec.md` names the *template* (`templates/spec-template.md`) but never an output path, so the orchestrator invented `.claude/specs/`. Result: the level-2 spec exists only as untracked local state and shows as `?? .claude/specs/` in every session's git status. Proposal M1.
- **Thrash check (PR #8):** 6 commits — 3 feature, 2 playtest-driven polish (cost rebalance, explosion animation, orbit), 1 correctness fix, 1 dead-code refactor. No fix-then-break cycles. Healthy iteration, not thrashing.
- Working as intended: counter/threshold mechanism, SessionStart context injection, agent-scoped holdouts deny (implementer verified denied).
